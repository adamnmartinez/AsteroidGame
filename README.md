### Asteroids - A game about saving the earth.

A meteor storm threatens the earth, and there's only one pilot who can stop it from destroying everything. How long can you hold out?

Asteroids (working title) is a 2D pixel-graphics arcade game made in Unity, written in C#. This project was developed independently by myself with the aim of teaching myself Unity. It is the first of many projects I plan to create with this versitile game development engine. All art and animations are made by myself.

The game is currently a work-in-progress, thus a playable executable is not yet available.
