### Asteroids - A game about saving the earth.

A shower of asteroids is on a collision path with earth, and there's only one pilot who can stop it from destroying everything. How long can you hold out?

Asteroids (working title) is a 2D pixel-graphics arcade game made in Unity, written in C#. I began development on this project with the goal of teaching myself Unity. It is the first of many projects I plan to create with this versitile game development engine. All art and animations are made by myself.

The playable executable can be found in the AsteroidsGame folder. Run it to play! 

The game is currently a work-in-progress.
